# `.zprofile' is similar to `.zlogin', except that it is sourced before `.zshrc'.
# `.zprofile' is meant as an alternative to `.zlogin' for ksh fans; the two are not intended to be used together, although this could certainly be done if desired.

# Add pyenv executable to PATH and
# enable shims by adding the following
# to ~/.profile and ~/.zprofile:

export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"

export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/shims/python:$PATH"
# eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
